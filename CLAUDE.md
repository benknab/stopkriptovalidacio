# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

Hungarian website documenting the timeline of cryptocurrency "validation" law changes and their
repercussions. The site will include:

-   Timeline of crypto regulation changes
-   Exchange information
-   MP (Member of Parliament) search functionality
-   MP email template generation and sending

## Planned Tech Stack

-   **Runtime**: Deno
-   **Framework**: SSR with React
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **Internationalization**: i18n support (Hungarian primary)

## Development Commands

Commands will be added as the project scaffolding is built. Expected patterns for Deno:

-   `deno task dev` - Start development server
-   `deno task build` - Production build
-   `deno lint` - Lint code
-   `deno fmt` - Format code
-   `deno test` - Run tests

## Design Guidelines

When building frontend components, follow the frontend-design skill principles:

-   Choose distinctive, bold aesthetic directions (avoid generic AI aesthetics)
-   Use unique typography choices (avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial)
-   Create cohesive color themes with dominant colors and sharp accents
-   Implement meaningful animations and micro-interactions
-   Consider unconventional layouts with intentional asymmetry and spatial composition

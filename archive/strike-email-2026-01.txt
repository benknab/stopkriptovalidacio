Due to new regulatory requirements in Hungary, we are unfortunately no longer able to support accounts in your country. We understand this isn't ideal, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this may cause.

Starting this Friday January 9, 2026 by 3 PM CET, your account will only support EUR and BTC withdrawals. All other features, including buy and sell, will be unavailable.

You can continue to withdraw your funds at any time, including after this Friday January 9, 2026. If you have questions or need assistance, our support team is here to help at support-eu@strike.me.

Thank you for being a valued Strike customer and for your understanding during this transition.

Best,
The Strike Team
